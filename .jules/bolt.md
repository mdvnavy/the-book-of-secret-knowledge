## 2024-04-13 - Batched Process Execution
**Learning:** Shell scripts using standard tools (like `openssl`, `cat`, `tr`, `fold`, `head`) suffer significant performance degradation when called inside a tight loop due to process fork overhead. Specifically, `openssl` called N times takes O(N) process forks.
**Action:** When working with shell snippet performance optimizations, replace loops containing binary invocations with single-pipeline batched operations whenever possible. For example, batch random byte generation by requesting `N * bytes` and folding the output instead of executing the generator N times. Also avoid unnecessary uses of `cat <file> | ...` when `< <file>` or native shell operations are available.

## 2024-05-15 - Unnecessary Process Forks in Shell Snippets
**Learning:** Using `jq '.Answer[0].data' | tr -d "\""` and `cat < /dev/null > /dev/tcp/...` introduce unnecessary process forks (`tr` and `cat`). These can be optimized using `jq -r` and native bash file descriptor redirection (`</dev/tcp/...`).
**Action:** When optimizing shell scripts, always check if `jq` can handle string formatting natively (e.g., using `-r` for raw output) to avoid piping to `tr` or `sed`. Also, leverage native bash file descriptors to avoid `cat` when creating empty streams or writing to network sockets.

## 2024-04-18 - jq raw output vs piping to tr
**Learning:** Piping `jq` string output to `tr -d "\""` creates an unnecessary process fork penalty. Using `jq -r` provides the exact same unquoted string natively, saving milliseconds and simplifying the snippet.
**Action:** Always check if string processing utilities (`tr`, `sed`, `awk`) piped after `jq` can be replaced by native `jq` features like the `-r` flag to eliminate process forks.
## 2026-05-20 - Parameter Expansion Over Subshells
**Learning:** Replacing subshells and external binaries (`echo | cut`) with native bash parameter expansion (`${VAR%%:*}` and `${VAR##*:}`) eliminates process forks and drastically improves performance in shell scripts.
**Action:** Always prefer native bash parameter expansion over piping to external commands for simple string manipulation.

## 2024-05-26 - Eliminate Process Forks in find -exec
**Learning:** In bash script snippets processing files, using `find -exec ... \;` spawns a new subprocess for every matched file, leading to severe performance bottlenecks on large directories. The `rmdir` operation can be fully native.
**Action:** Replace `find -exec ... \;` with `find -exec ... +` to batch arguments into a single subprocess execution. Replace `-exec rmdir {} \;` with `-delete` (using `-mindepth 1` if necessary to protect the root dir) to utilize find's native C-level deletion, completely bypassing subshells.

## 2025-02-12 - Heredoc Variables and pkill over ps|grep
**Learning:** When using heredocs to generate scripts, leaving the EOF delimiter unquoted causes premature variable expansion (e.g., `$(whoami)`). Additionally, chaining `ps | grep | awk` inside a `for` loop creates significant subshell and process fork overhead.
**Action:** Always quote the heredoc delimiter (e.g., `<< '__EOF__'`) when the intent is to write literal script logic containing variables. Replace chained process inspections with a single native `pkill` command (e.g., `pkill -9 -f "sshd.*${username}" || true`) to eliminate process forks.
