**Learning:** Shell scripts using standard tools (like `openssl`, `cat`, `tr`, `fold`, `head`) suffer significant performance degradation when called inside a tight loop due to process fork overhead. Specifically, `openssl` called N times takes O(N) process forks.
**Action:** When working with shell snippet performance optimizations, replace loops containing binary invocations with single-pipeline batched operations whenever possible. For example, batch random byte generation by requesting `N * bytes` and folding the output instead of executing the generator N times. Also avoid unnecessary uses of `cat <file> | ...` when `< <file>` or native shell operations are available.

## 2024-05-15 - Unnecessary Process Forks in Shell Snippets
**Learning:** Using `jq '.Answer[0].data' | tr -d "\""` and `cat < /dev/null > /dev/tcp/...` introduce unnecessary process forks (`tr` and `cat`). These can be optimized using `jq -r` and native bash file descriptor redirection (`</dev/tcp/...`).
**Action:** When optimizing shell scripts, always check if `jq` can handle string formatting natively (e.g., using `-r` for raw output) to avoid piping to `tr` or `sed`. Also, leverage native bash file descriptors to avoid `cat` when creating empty streams or writing to network sockets.
